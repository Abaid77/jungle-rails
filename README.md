# Jungle Project for Light House Labs

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 for purposes of teaching Rails by example. This project was built as a student at Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp. This project was a test of being able to learn a new language in a short time and update an exsisting code base.

## App Functions

### Feature: Sold Out Badge
Major: When a product has 0 quantity, a sold out badge should be displayed on the product list page
Minor: Should ideally be implemented as a question/boolean method in view helper and/or Product model
### Feature: Admin Categories
 - Major: Admin users can list and create new categories
 - Major: Admins can add new products using the new category
 - Major: Restful routes (resources) should be used, and there should be no extra, unused routes exposed
 - Bonus: All admin controllers inherit from Admin::BaseController (or similarly named) abstract controller, containing the authentication filter
### Feature: User Authentication
 - Major: As a Visitor I can go to the registration page from any page in order to create an account
 - Major: As a Visitor I can sign up for a user account with my e-mail, password, first name and last name
 - Major: As a Visitor I can sign in using my e-mail and password
 - Major: As a User I can log out from any page
 - Major: As a User I cannot sign up with an existing e-mail address (uniqueness validation)
 - Major: Passwords are not stored as plain text in the database. Instead, has_secure_password is used in the User model, leveraging the bcrypt gem
### Enhancement: Order Details Page
 - Major: The order page contains items, their image, name, description, quantities and line item totals
 - Major: The final amount for the order is displayed
 - Minor: The email that was used to place the order is displayed
 - Minor: As a Visitor I can place an order (i.e. without logging in and therefore without an e-mail address). The original functionality from the inherited code (even though it is not realistic) should therefore not be suppressed.
